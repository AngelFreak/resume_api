# resume-api


## What is it?
Open source REST API for my [JSON-based standard format resume](https://jsonresume.org/). I'm using
[Go](https://golang.org/) for serving the API.

## How can I see or use it?
You can hit the REST API via curl:
```sh
curl -L https://resume.tsrv.pw
```
You can view it via web browser:

https://resume.tsrv.pw

## Why
[To build something simple with Go to get more experience with the language]
To expose my resume as an API as [JSON-based standard for resumes](https://jsonresume.org/).
